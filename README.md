# Project Euler Solutions

Welcome to my collection of solutions for Project Euler! This repository contains the solutions to various mathematical and computational problems that I am working on as part of the Project Euler challenge.

# About Project Euler

Project Euler is a platform that offers a collection of challenging problems that require mathematical insights and computational techniques to solve. It’s an excellent way to improve your problem-solving and coding skills.

# Repository Overview

Each problem is stored in a separate folder, and each folder is named after the title of the problem. Inside each folder, you will find two files:
1. problem.txt: Contains the description and problem statement from Project Euler.
2. solution.cpp: Contains my C++ implementation of the solution.

# Folder Structure

Here's the structure of this repository:

```bash
ProjectEuler/
│
├── Problem-Title-1/
│   ├── problem.txt
│   └── solution.cpp
│
├── Problem-Title-2/
│   ├── problem.txt
│   └── solution.cpp
│
└── README.md
```
Example:
```
├── Multiples-of-3-and-5/
│   ├── problem.txt       # Contains the problem statement
│   └── solution.cpp      # Contains my C++ solution
```
# How to Run the Solutions

1. Clone the repository: Open a terminal and use the following command to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShivaanjayNarula/Project-Euler.git
```

2. Navigate to the desired problem folder: Use the cd command to go to the directory of the problem you want to run. For example, to navigate to the Multiples of and 5 problem:

```bash
cd Multiples-of-3-and-5
```

3. Compile and the solution: Use the following command to compile the C++ file:

```bash
g++ solution.cpp -o solution
```

4. Run the solution: After compiling, run the executable file using:

```
./solution
```
